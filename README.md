Programmers: Bosco Zhang, Liam Ma, Nihal Sidhu

For our ICS 4U1 Computer Science culminating CPT, we present a crossover game of Super Mario Racing, featuring playable Brawl Stars characters. 

In this game, you can choose from two maps and two characters. 

## ⚙️ Instructions & Setup

Here are some instructions on how to navigate our game:

#### 1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/BoscoZhangers/SuperMario-Brawlstars.git
```

#### 2. Enter the repo:
```
cd SuperMario-Brawlstars
```

#### 3.

   Before connecting, if you want to play the tutorial press the tutorial button on the menu screen, which is only available on single-player modes.
  
4. Racing against friends is available for multi-player once the user connects to a network server (via socket programming) using the "connect" button.
   
5. If you want to host, enter a username and port number in the designated fields then press connect

6. If you want to connect to the host as a client, enter a username and the host's IP address and port number; then press connect.

7. As the host, press the back button then the play button

8. As the host, select a map

9. Host and client selects characters

10. Character movement is conducted entirely through the KeyListener of the direction arrow keys (forward/backward and up for jump).

11. Jump mechanics incorporate a spontaneous gravitational restriction on character's Y vector.

12. Jump mechanics limit the frequency of jump instances in a given interval (specifically, users cannot hold jump infinitely to avoid gravity).

13. You are now ready to play. Have fun!!
